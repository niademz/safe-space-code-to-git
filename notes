<input>: This is an HTML element used to create various types of input fields, such as text boxes, radio buttons, checkboxes, etc. In this case, it's used to create a text input field.

id="your_username": This attribute assigns an identifier (ID) to the input field. IDs are used to uniquely identify HTML elements, and they must be unique within the HTML document. In this case, the ID is set to "your_username."

placeholder="Enter your username": This attribute provides a placeholder text that is displayed inside the input field before the user enters any text. It serves as a visual hint to users about what kind of information is expected. In this case, the placeholder text is "Enter your username."  ^
